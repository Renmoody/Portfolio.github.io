                <h3>StudyGo - September-December 2024 (In progress)</a></h3>
                <p>StudyGo is an academic social media app with the goal of facilitating good study habits for 
                    students and raising the average GPA of participating Universities and consequently their students. 
                    This will be achieved by incentivizing studying at different locations near campus through giving 
                    them discount codes at participating locations. This app will allow users to connect either one 
                    on one or by public group sessions through networking and a messaging platform. Students have the 
                    option to track their grades per class and see a visualization of study time to grade performance 
                    over a semester. Teachers will be able to use this app to set up different study events and 
                    companies can set-up study events as well. This will all be achievable through web browser, 
                    android, and ios applications.</p>

                <h3>Hoohacks Hackathon : Emergency Void Detection Program - Spring 2024</h3>
                <p>This application was built in a team of four people. Our team had 24 hours to code a project from scratch and compete for prizes. Our goal 
                    was to create an application that protected the public against harm. Our idea was Fruble. This project is geared towards public safety. 
                    Unfortunately, people end up in positions where they need help but cannot use their mobile device due to dangerous conditions. 
                    Our application will use audio 
                    detection software to allow the user to use a safe sentance. Doing so will alert local authorities and send and 
                    SMS message to contacts of their choosing along with their location with live updates.
